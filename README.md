| [2429. Minimize XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-xor/) | 0 ms | 28.5 MB | Solved after 3 hours, discussed with chatgpt, confirmed shifting is needed, implemented totally myself
| [2425. Bitwise XOR of All Pairings](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-xor-of-all-pairings/) | 1 ms | 68.7 MB | Solved after 5th attempt after experimenting, brute force, out of memory, time limit exceeded wrong submissions. LeetCode 2nd hint helped and inspired to focus on array lengths, can't really explain the intuition, but it is related to feature "XOR with itself results in 0", then experimenting with array sizes which led to even/odd checks
| [2683. Neighboring Bitwise XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/neighboring-bitwise-xor/) | 2 ms | 61.8 MB | Can't explain my approach, was playing around with test cases and pen-and-paper - simulation. The solution leverages the property of XOR where a ^ b = c implies a ^ c = b, allowing the reconstruction of the original array dynamically. By iterating through all elements of the `derived` array except the last one, the code calculates the cumulative XOR of all derived values, starting with an initial `start` value of 0. This process simulates reconstructing the original array's values. The final check compares whether the XOR of `start` and 0 equals the last element of `derived`, ensuring that the cyclic condition is satisfied and confirming the existence of a valid binary `original` array.
| [3151. Special Array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-i/) | 0 ms | 46.6 MB | Bitwise operation to determine parity. Just remember, odd number + even number = odd number, even number + even number = even number, odd number + odd number = even number
| [1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-is-sorted-and-rotated/) | 0 ms | 43.7 MB | The idea is to determine rotation split. This means we found a theoretical start and end of the sorted array. This means that all values after rotation split must maintain non-decreasing order AND ALSO be less than or equal the nums[0], i.e. min number of the left sorted half.
